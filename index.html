        <p>
         I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Uttara University, Bangladesh. I love learning new things about technology. I started coding with the C language using SPL in my early days. Later, I learned C++, C#, and Java. These languages helped me understand programming better. I enjoy learning how computers and software work.

            Now I am learning web development. I have learned HTML, CSS, and MySQL for making websites. In the future, I want to learn JavaScript to make my websites more active and useful. My goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, work on open-source projects, and become a good software developer. I like to work with others, learn new things, and explore new technology every day.
